# Monokai Pro Terminator terminal Color Theme

If you like Monokai Pro and are looking for a Terminator theme based on it. Here's the palette.
```
[[MonokaiPro]]
    background_color = "#403e41"
    cursor_color = "#fcfcfa"
    cursor_color_fg = False
    foreground_color = "#fcfcfa"
    palette = "#403e41:#ff6188:#a9dc76:#ffd866:#fc9867:#ab9df2:#78dce8:#fcfcfa:#727072:#ff6188:#a9dc76:#ffd866:#fc9867:#ab9df2:#78dce8:#fcfcfa"
```

Just add it to the `[profiles]` section of the terminator config file (`$HOME/.config/terminator/config` for most Linux distros)
